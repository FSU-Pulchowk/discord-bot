## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Pulchowk Discord Bot up and running.

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16.x or higher recommended)
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
  * A [Discord Account](https://discord.com/)
  * A [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/fsupulchowk/discord-bot.git](https://github.com/fsupulchowk/discord-bot.git)
    cd discord-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of project. This file will store sensitive information and configuration.

### 1\. Discord Bot Setup

1.  **Create a Discord Application:**
      - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
      - Click "New Application". Give it a name (e.g., "Pulchowk Bot").
2.  **Create a Bot User:**
      - In application, go to the "Bot" tab.
      - Click "Add Bot" and confirm.
      - **Reveal Token:** Click "Reset Token" and copy the token. This is `BOT_TOKEN`. **Keep it secret\!**
3.  **Enable Gateway Intents:**
      - Under the "Bot" tab, scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents".
      - Enable **PRESENCE INTENT**, **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**, and **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**. These are crucial for the bot's functionality.
4.  **Get Client ID:**
      - Go to the "General Information" tab. Copy the "Application ID". This is `CLIENT_ID`.
5.  **Get Guild ID (for testing):**
      - In Discord server, enable "Developer Mode" (User Settings -\> Advanced).
      - Right-click on server icon in Discord and select "Copy ID". This is `GUILD_ID`.
6.  **Invite the Bot to Server:**
      - Go to the "OAuth2" -\> "URL Generator" tab.
      - Select `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
      - Under "Bot Permissions", select the following:
          - `Administrator` (simplest for full functionality, but grant specific permissions for production if you prefer)
          - Alternatively, grant specific permissions: `Manage Roles`, `Kick Members`, `Ban Members`, `Moderate Members`, `Manage Channels`, `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`, `Add Reactions`, `Use External Emojis`, `Read Message History`, `Connect`, `Speak`, `Mute Members`, `Deafen Members`, `Move Members`.
      - Copy the generated URL and paste it into browser to invite the bot.
7.  **Create a "Verified" Role:**
      - In Discord server, go to Server Settings -\> Roles.
      - Create a new role named "Verified" (or anything you prefer).
      - **Copy its ID:** Right-click the role and select "Copy ID". This is `VERIFIED_ROLE_ID`. Ensure this role is positioned **below** bot's role in the server's role hierarchy so the bot can assign it.

### 2\. Google Cloud Project Setup (for Gmail & Calendar APIs)

This bot uses Google APIs for email verification and holiday announcements.

1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project:**
      - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
      - Create a new project or select an existing one.
2.  **Enable APIs:**
      - In project, navigate to "APIs & Services" -\> "Enabled APIs & Services".
      - Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES".
      - Search for and enable:
          - **Gmail API** (for sending OTP emails)
          - **Google Calendar API** (for `/holidays` command)
3.  **Create OAuth Consent Screen:**
      - Go to "APIs & Services" -\> "OAuth consent screen".
      - Configure it (choose "External" for personal use, fill in required info).
      - Add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` as a scope.
      - Add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` as a scope.
      - Add email as a test user.
4.  **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (for Gmail API):**
      - Go to "APIs & Services" -\> "Credentials".
      - Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and choose "OAuth client ID".
      - Select "Desktop app" as the application type.
      - Copy `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
      - **Generate Refresh Token:**
          - Go to [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).
          - In the left pane, authorize the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` scope and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` scope.
          - Click "Authorize APIs".
          - Select Google account and grant permissions.
          - Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens".
          - Copy the `Refresh Token`. This is `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
          - Set `REDIRECT_URI` in `.env` to `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` (or custom URI if you set one up).
      - Set `SENDER_EMAIL` in `.env` to the email address you want the OTPs to be sent from (must be associated with Google Workspace account).
5.  **Create Service Account Key (for Google Calendar API - Optional but Recommended):**
      - Go to "APIs & Services" -\> "Credentials".
      - Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and choose "Service Account".
      - Follow the steps to create a new service account.
      - Grant it the "Calendar Viewer" role (or a custom role with `calendar.events.list` permission).
      - After creation, click on the service account email.
      - Go to the "Keys" tab and click "ADD KEY" -\> "Create new key".
      - Select "JSON" and click "CREATE". A JSON file will download.
      - **Rename this file to `service_account_key.json`** and place it in the **root directory of bot project**.
      - Set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH="./service_account_key.json"` in `.env`.
      - Set `GOOGLE_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR_ID` in `.env` (e.g., `'en.nepali#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com'` for Nepal holidays).

### 3\. Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of project and populate it with the values obtained from the previous steps.

Slash commands need to be registered with Discord. You can deploy them to a specific guild for testing or globally for production.

  - **For testing (recommended):** Deploy to specific test guild.
    ```bash
    node deploy-commands.js --guild
    ```
  - **For global deployment (production):** This can take up to an hour to propagate.
    ```bash
    node deploy-commands.js --global
    ```

### 6\. Running the Bot

Once commands are deployed, you can start bot:

```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment on Render.com

This section provides detailed instructions for deploying bot on Render.com.

**Important Note on Database Persistence:**
Bot uses SQLite (`bot.db`) for data storage. Render's standard web services use ephemeral storage, meaning any data written to the disk (like `bot.db` file) will be lost on redeploys or restarts. To ensure bot's data (user stats, anti-spam configs, suggestions, etc.) persists, you **must** configure a persistent disk.

### Steps to Deploy:

1.  **Push Code to a Git Repository:**

      - Ensure all bot files (including the `src` folder, `deploy-commands.js`, `package.json`, `.env.example` if you create one, and `service_account_key.json` if using it) are committed and pushed to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
      - **Crucially, add `bot.db` and `service_account_key.json` to `.gitignore` file if repository is public\!** You will upload `service_account_key.json` as a secret file on Render, and `bot.db` will be created by the persistent disk.

2.  **Create a Render Account:**

      - If you don't have one, sign up at [Render.com](https://render.com/). You can sign in with GitHub account.

3.  **Create a New Web Service:**

      - From Render Dashboard, click **"New"** -\> **"Web Service"**.
      - **Connect Git repository:** Select the repository where bot's code is hosted. You might need to grant Render access to repository.
      - Click **"Connect"**.

4.  **Configure Web Service:**

      - **Name:** Give service a meaningful name (e.g., `pulchowk-discord-bot`).
      - **Region:** Choose a region closest to users or where you prefer.
      - **Branch:** Select the Git branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main` or `master`).
      - **Root Directory:** If `package.json` is not in the root of repository (e.g., it's in a `bot/` folder), specify that folder here. Otherwise, leave it blank.
      - **Runtime:** `Node`
      - **Build Command:** `npm install`
      - **Start Command:** `npm start` (This uses the `start` script defined in `package.json`)
      - **Instance Type:** Choose a suitable instance type. The "Free" tier might be sufficient for a small bot, but keep in mind free instances spin down after inactivity. A paid tier (e.g., "Starter") is recommended for 24/7 uptime.

5.  **Add Environment Variables:**

      - Scroll down to the **"Environment Variables"** section.
      - Add each key-value pair from local `.env` file here.
      - **Important:** For `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`, you will use a **secret file** instead of an environment variable.

6.  **Add Secret File for `service_account_key.json`:**

      - Still in the **"Environment Variables"** section, click **"Add Secret File"**.
      - **Filename:** `service_account_key.json` (This must exactly match the filename you set in `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` in `.env` and the path in `holidays.js` command).
      - **Content:** Copy and paste the entire content of local `service_account_key.json` file into this text area.
      - Click **"Add Secret File"**.

7.  **Configure Persistent Disk (Crucial for SQLite):**

      - Scroll down to the **"Disks"** section.
      - Click **"Add Disk"**.
      - **Name:** `bot-data` (or any descriptive name).
      - **Mount Path:** `/opt/render/project/bot.db` (This is the path where Render expects `bot.db` file to be stored persistently. It aligns with where `database.js` creates the `bot.db` file relative to the project root on Render's file system).
      - **Size:** Choose a small size (e.g., 1 GB) as SQLite databases are typically small.
      - Click **"Add Disk"**.

8.  **Create Web Service:**

      - Click **"Create Web Service"** at the bottom.

9.  **Monitor Deployment:**

      - Render will now start building and deploying bot. You can monitor the progress in the logs.
      - If the build fails, check the build logs for errors (e.g., missing dependencies, syntax errors).
      - If the deploy succeeds but the bot doesn't come online, check the runtime logs for errors (e.g., incorrect environment variables, bot token issues, API key problems).

### After Deployment:

  - **Verify Bot Status:** Check Discord server to see if the bot is online.
  - **Test Commands:** Try using slash commands (`/verify`) and prefix commands (`!help`, `!setbirthday`, etc.) to ensure everything is working as expected.
  - **Data Persistence:** After testing, try manually restarting Render service. Then, check if `/mystats` or `/listsuggestions` data is still present. If it is, persistent disk is working correctly.

**Troubleshooting Tips for Render:**

  - **"Web service failed to start"**: Check `Start Command` and ensure `package.json` `start` script is correct (`node src/bot.js`).
  - **"Cannot find module"**: Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json` and `npm install` ran successfully during the build.
  - **Bot goes offline**: If on a free tier, it will spin down after inactivity. Upgrade to a paid instance type for 24/7 uptime.
  - **Errors related to Google APIs**: Double-check all Google API environment variables and the `service_account_key.json` content. Ensure the API is enabled in Google Cloud Console.
  - **Permissions errors (Discord)**: Verify bot's permissions in the Discord Developer Portal and its role hierarchy in server.

## Hosting on Local Server using Docker

To host your Pulchowk Discord Bot on a local server using Docker, follow these steps:

**1. Prerequisites:**

  * **Docker:** Make sure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine for Linux) is installed and running on your system.

**2. Project Setup:**

  * **Place Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`:** Ensure the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files are in the root directory of your bot project, alongside your `package.json` and `src` directory.
  * **`.env` file:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with all the necessary environment variables as described in the `README.md` file, including your Discord bot token, Google API credentials, and other configurations.
    ```env
    BOT_TOKEN="_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
    CLIENT_ID="_DISCORD_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
    GUILD_ID="_DISCORD_GUILD_ID_HERE"
    VERIFIED_ROLE_ID="_VERIFIED_ROLE_ID_HERE"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
    REDIRECT_URI="https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground"
    REFRESH_TOKEN="_GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE"
    SENDER_EMAIL="-college-email@pulchowk.edu.np"
    GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH="./service_account_key.json"
    GOOGLE_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR_ID="en.nepali#holiday@group.v.calendar.google.com"
    TARGET_NOTICE_CHANNEL_ID="_NOTICE_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
    NOTICE_ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID="_NOTICE_ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
    NOTICE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS=1800000
    SUGGESTIONS_CHANNEL_ID="_SUGGESTIONS_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
    BIRTHDAY_ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL_ID="_BIRTHDAY_ANNOUNCEMENT_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
    BOT_PREFIX="!"
    ```
  * **`service_account_key.json`:** If you are using the Google Calendar API, ensure your `service_account_key.json` file is in the root directory of your project.

**3. Deploy Slash Commands (One-Time Setup):**

Before running the bot with Docker, you need to deploy the slash commands to Discord. This is typically done directly using Node.js, not within the Docker container build process for the first time.

1.  **Install dependencies locally (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Deploy slash commands:**
      * For testing on a specific guild (recommended for local development):
        ```bash
        node deploy-commands.js --guild
        ```
      * For global deployment (takes up to an hour to propagate):
        ```bash
        node deploy-commands.js --global
        ```

**4. Build and Run with Docker Compose:**

Navigate to the root directory of your bot project in your terminal where `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are located.

1.  **Build the Docker image:** This command will build the image defined in your `Dockerfile`.
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```
2.  **Start the bot:** This command will create and start the Docker container for your bot.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
      * `fsu-discord-bot` is the service name defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
      * The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background).

**Explanation of `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`:**

  * **`Dockerfile`**:

      * `FROM node:20-slim`: Uses a slim Node.js 20 image as the base, which is good for smaller image sizes.
      * `RUN groupadd -r botuser && useradd -r -g botuser -d /app -s /bin/bash botuser`: Creates a non-root user `botuser` for security best practices.
      * `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
      * `RUN chown -R botuser:botuser /app`: Ensures the `botuser` owns the working directory.
      * `RUN apt-get update ... chromium ...`: Installs necessary system dependencies, including `chromium` for web scraping (Puppeteer).
      * `ENV PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium`: Configures Puppeteer to use the installed Chromium.
      * `COPY --chown=botuser:botuser package*.json ./`: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) to leverage Docker's build cache.
      * `USER botuser`: Switches to the `botuser`.
      * `RUN npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force`: Installs production dependencies and cleans the npm cache. `npm ci` is used for clean installs in CI/CD environments.
      * `COPY --chown=botuser:botuser . .`: Copies the rest of your application code into the container.
      * `CMD ["node", "./src/bot.js"]`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts. This executes your main bot file.

  * **`docker-compose.yml`**:

      * `version: "3.8"`: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.
      * `services:`: Defines the services (containers) for your application.
          * `fsu-discord-bot`: The name of your bot service.
          * `container_name: fsu-discord-bot`: Assigns a specific name to the container.
          * `image: agntperfect/fsu-discord-bot`: Specifies the image to build/use. If you change the `image` name, remember to update it here.
          * `user: botuser`: Runs the container process as the `botuser` created in the Dockerfile.
          * `security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true`: Enhances security by preventing privilege escalation.
          * `env_file: - .env`: Tells Docker Compose to load environment variables from your local `.env` file into the container.
          * `restart: unless-stopped`: Configures the container to restart automatically unless it's explicitly stopped.
          * `volumes:`: Defines data persistence.
              * `- fsu_data:/app/data:rw`: This mounts a Docker volume named `fsu_data` to `/app/data` inside the container. If your bot needs to write any *other* persistent data (e.g., logs, temporary files) besides `bot.db` in a specific `/app/data` directory, this volume will ensure it persists across container restarts.
              * `- ./bot.db:/app/bot.db:rw`: This is crucial for SQLite persistence. It mounts your local `bot.db` file (or creates it if it doesn't exist) directly into the container at `/app/bot.db`. Any changes to `bot.db` inside the container will be reflected on your host machine, ensuring data persistence.
          * `tmpfs: - /tmp`: Mounts a `tmpfs` (temporary file system) at `/tmp` for temporary files, which improves performance and security by not writing ephemeral data to disk.
          * `logging:`: Configures logging for the container.
          * `networks: - fsu_net`: Connects the bot to a custom Docker network.
      * `volumes: fsu_data: driver: local`: Defines the named volume `fsu_data`.
      * `networks: fsu_net: ...`: Defines the custom bridge network for the services.

**5. Verify and Manage:**

  * **Check container status:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```
  * **View logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs fsu-discord-bot
    ```
  * **Stop the bot:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    This will stop and remove the container and the `fsu_net` network, but the `fsu_data` volume and your local `bot.db` file will persist.
  * **Stop and remove everything (including volumes):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down --volumes
    ```
    *Use with caution*, as `--volumes` will delete the `fsu_data` volume, but your explicit `bot.db` bind mount will keep `bot.db` on your host.

**Important Considerations:**

  * **Firewall:** Ensure your local firewall isn't blocking outgoing connections from the Docker container to Discord or Google APIs.
  * **`service_account_key.json`:** Since you're mounting the current directory, the `service_account_key.json` file should be accessible to the bot within the container at the path specified in your `.env` file (`./service_account_key.json` relative to `/app`).
  * **Initial `bot.db`:** The `database.js` script in your bot's `src` directory is responsible for creating the `bot.db` file and its tables if it doesn't exist. When you first run the container, it will create this file on your host machine at the path specified in the volume mount (`./bot.db`).
  * **Updates:** If you make changes to your bot's code, you'll need to rebuild the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
